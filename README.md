# porch - A Portable Process Orchestration Framework

**porch** is a sophisticated Go-based process orchestration framework designed for running and managing complex command workflows. It provides a flexible, YAML-driven approach to define, compose, and execute command chains with advanced flow control, parallel processing, and comprehensive error handling.

## ‚ú® Features

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Workflow

Create a YAML file defining your command workflow:

```yaml
name: "Build and Test Workflow"
description: "Complete CI/CD pipeline example"
commands:
  - type: "shell"
    name: "Setup Environment"
    command_line: "echo 'Setting up build environment...'"

  - type: "parallel"
    name: "Quality Checks"
    commands:
      - type: "shell"
        name: "Run Tests"
        command_line: "go test ./..."

      - type: "shell"
        name: "Run Linter"
        command_line: "golangci-lint run"

      - type: "shell"
        name: "Security Scan"
        command_line: "gosec ./..."

  - type: "serial"
    name: "Build and Package"
    commands:
      - type: "shell"
        name: "Build Application"
        command_line: "go build -o app ."

      - type: "copycwdtotemp"
        name: "Copy to Temp"

      - type: "shell"
        name: "Create Archive"
        command_line: "tar -czf app.tar.gz app"
```

### Execute the workflow

```bash
porch run workflow.yaml
```

### View saved results

```bash
porch show results.gob
```

## üìö Available Commands

porch provides a CLI with the following commands:

### `porch run <workflow.yaml>`

Execute a workflow defined in a YAML file.

**Options:**

- Reads YAML workflow definition
- Executes commands according to their type (serial, parallel, shell, etc.)
- Handles signal interruption gracefully
- Saves execution results for later analysis

### `porch show <results.gob>`

Display the results of a previous workflow execution.

**Features:**

- Pretty-printed tree visualization
- Colorized output with error highlighting
- Detailed execution metrics
- JSON export capability

## üõ†Ô∏è Command Types

porch supports several built-in command types for different execution patterns:

### 1. Shell Commands

Execute any shell command with full environment control:

```yaml
- type: "shell"
  name: "Build Project"
  command_line: "go build -o app ."
  working_directory: "/path/to/project"
  env:
    CGO_ENABLED: "0"
    GOOS: "linux"
```

### 2. Serial Batches

Execute commands sequentially where order matters:

```yaml
- type: "serial"
  name: "Setup and Build"
  commands:
    - type: "shell"
      name: "Install Dependencies"
      command_line: "go mod download"
    - type: "shell"
      name: "Build"
      command_line: "go build ."
```

### 3. Parallel Batches

Execute independent commands concurrently for optimal performance:

```yaml
- type: "parallel"
  name: "Quality Checks"
  commands:
    - type: "shell"
      name: "Run Tests"
      command_line: "go test ./..."
    - type: "shell"
      name: "Run Linter"
      command_line: "golangci-lint run"
    - type: "shell"
      name: "Security Scan"
      command_line: "gosec ./..."
```

### 4. Copy Current Working Directory to Temp

A specialized command for working in temporary directories:

```yaml
- type: "copycwdtotemp"
  name: "Work in Isolation"
  cwd: "."
```

This command copies the current working directory to a temporary location, allowing subsequent commands to work in isolation without affecting the original directory.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Common Fields

All commands support these common configuration options:

```yaml
- type: "shell"
  name: "Command Name"                    # Descriptive name for the command
  working_directory: "/custom/path"       # Override working directory
  runs_on_condition: "success"           # When to run: success, error, always, exit-codes
  runs_on_exit_codes: [0, 1]            # Specific exit codes (when runs_on_condition is exit-codes)
  env:                                   # Environment variables
    KEY: "value"
    PATH: "/custom/bin:$PATH"
```

### Conditional Execution

Control when commands run based on previous results:

```yaml
- type: "shell"
  name: "Cleanup on Error"
  command_line: "rm -rf temp_files"
  runs_on_condition: "error"           # Only run if previous commands failed

- type: "shell"
  name: "Deploy on Success"
  command_line: "./deploy.sh"
  runs_on_condition: "success"         # Only run if previous commands succeeded

- type: "shell"
  name: "Always Cleanup"
  command_line: "cleanup.sh"
  runs_on_condition: "always"          # Always run regardless of previous results
```

## üîß Extending porch

### Creating Custom Commands

Implement the `Commander` interface to create custom command types:

```go
package mycommand

import (
    "context"
    "github.com/matt-FFFFFF/porch/internal/commands"
    "github.com/matt-FFFFFF/porch/internal/runbatch"
)

type MyCommander struct{}

func (c *MyCommander) Create(ctx context.Context, payload []byte) (runbatch.Runnable, error) {
    // Parse payload (YAML command definition)
    // Create and return a Runnable implementation
    return myRunnable, nil
}

// Register the command in init()
func init() {
    commands.Register("mycommand", &MyCommander{})
}
```

### Implementing Runnable

Create custom execution logic by implementing the `Runnable` interface:

```go
type MyRunnable struct {
    // Command configuration
}

func (r *MyRunnable) Run(ctx context.Context) runbatch.Results {
    // Implement execution logic
    // Handle context cancellation
    // Return structured results
}

func (r *MyRunnable) SetCwd(cwd string) {
    // Set working directory
}

func (r *MyRunnable) InheritEnv(env map[string]string) {
    // Inherit environment variables
}
```

description: "Run tests in isolated temporary directory"
commands:
  - type: "serial"
    name: "Isolated Test Workflow"

        name: "Generate Report"
        command_line: "go test -json ./... > test-results.json"
```

## üé® Output and Results

### Result Structure

Every command execution produces detailed results:

```go
type Result struct {
    ExitCode  int           // Command exit code
    Error     error         // Any execution error
    StdOut    []byte        // Standard output
    StdErr    []byte        // Standard error
    Label     string        // Command label/name
    Children  Results       // Nested command results
}
```

### Pretty-Printed Output

porch automatically generates beautiful tree-structured output:

```text
‚úì Build and Test Workflow
  ‚úì Setup Environment (0ms)
  ‚úì Quality Checks (2.1s)
    ‚úì Run Tests (1.8s)
    ‚úì Run Linter (1.2s)
    ‚úó Security Scan (0.5s) - exit code 1
  ‚úì Build Process (1.5s)
    ‚úì Build for Linux (0.8s)
    ‚úì Build for macOS (0.7s)
```

### JSON Export

Results can be exported as JSON for programmatic analysis:

```bash
porch show results.gob --format=json
```

## üö¶ Signal Handling

porch provides sophisticated signal handling for graceful shutdown:

- **First Signal (SIGINT/SIGTERM)**: Initiates graceful shutdown
  - Running commands receive the signal for cleanup
  - No new commands are started
  - Context remains active for cleanup operations

- **Second Signal**: Forces immediate termination
  - Context is cancelled
  - All running processes are killed
  - Execution stops immediately

This allows for proper cleanup and prevents data corruption during interruption.

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
make testcover

# Run linter
make lint
```

The project includes comprehensive tests covering:

- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for command execution
- Error handling scenarios
- Signal handling behavior
- Result formatting and output
